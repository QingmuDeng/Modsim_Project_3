#### Question:
Which initial condition of the second satellite will result in the longest and shortest time before a significant divergence?

In the classical 3-body problem, three masses with initial sets of positions and velocities are placed into a single system. Their subsequent motions, via gravitational forces, can only be modeled numerically.

The system is complicated with the introduction of a fourth body that has slightly different initial conditions with one of the original three. Chaos can then be measured by tracking the gradual divergence between the two similar bodies.

This could be an interesting model for international space programs since they launch multiple satellites at a time into space, making potential divergence between the satellites crucial to understand.
